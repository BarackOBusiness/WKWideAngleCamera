# White Knuckle Wide Angle Camera Mod
A mod that implements stereographic projection in White Knuckle to allow for much greater fields of view with minimal distortion.

## TODO
- [x] Make camera repond to ingame field of view slider
- [x] Implement fov effects from sprinting and consumables
- [x] Zoom camera fov when using upgrade terminals for visibility
- [ ] Make it so that the grab points match the projection at higher fields of view
- [ ] Maybe more I'm forgetting?
